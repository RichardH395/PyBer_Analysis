# **PyBer_Analysis**

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
V.Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

***Ride-sharing data***

The images and graphs Below shows the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. 

### Total Rides

We can see that majority of the rides are done in Urban Areas. This is logical following how large cities utilize ride-sharing services compared to Suburban and Rural areas.
Urban Rides - 1,625
Suburban Rides - 625
Rural Rides - 125


### Total Fares

It's not coincidence that the most amount of the fares are done in Urban Areas as well:
Urban Fares - $39,854.38
Suburban Fares - $19,356.33
Rural Fares - $4,327.90

### Total Drivers

Adding onto this we see that the most drivers are also located in Urban areas due to heavy demand and larger traffic. 
Urban Drivers - 2,405
Suburban Drivers - 490
Rural Drivers - 78

### Average fare per ride and driver

As we can see and infer, is that Rural area Averages are the highest given the larger commutes, cost, and time to complete these trips. We see as the area gets larger and busier we see averages go down as trips are shorter and more frequent, drivind down the averages as the size grows. 


## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

This exploratory analysis allows us to provide insight for strategy and development for Pyber:
- Urban areas have more drivers, usage, and lowest fares by average.
- Majority of the ride share services are done in Urban Areas.
- Focus on Rural and Suburban rides according to average fare per ride and the amount of drivers available in the area.
